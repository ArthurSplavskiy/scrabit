It is, indeed, not the most popular investment option. But what about the vehicles that can actually be a good investment? It’s not easy to spot a future classic car, even if your taste in cars is splendid. Of course, anyone would look for a reliable, high-quality automobile from a well-known brand – especially if this brand is beloved among car enthusiasts. But there’s much more depth to those gems that will gain value as they age.</strong> <p>Our amazing team of designers, developers, writers, strategists, etc. have been working their tails off for us the last year or so to make sure we have THE BEST car selling experience out there. And guess what! Now we do. Wanna hear about it? I thought so.</p> <h2>2. BMW M3 E46</h2> <img src='/images/article.png' />",
